			<h2>NASA’s SOFIA Discovers Water on Sunlit Surface of Moon</h2>


			<p>NASA’s Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) has confirmed, for the first time, water on the sunlit surface of the Moon. This discovery indicates that water may be distributed across the lunar surface, and not limited to cold, shadowed places.<span id="dots"></span></p>


			<div id="more">
				<p>SOFIA has detected water molecules (H2O) in Clavius Crater, one of the largest craters visible from Earth, located in the Moon’s southern hemisphere. Previous observations of the Moon’s surface detected some form of hydrogen, but were unable to distinguish between water and its close chemical relative, hydroxyl (OH). Data from this location reveal&nbsp;water in concentrations of 100 to 412 parts per million – roughly equivalent to a 12-ounce bottle of water – trapped in a cubic meter of soil spread across the lunar surface. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-01222-x#_blank">results are published</a> in the latest issue of Nature Astronomy.</p>

			<h1>Our Purpose</h1>

			<img class="galaxyImg" src="resources/milkywaylocation.jpg" alt="Our location in the Milky Way.">

			<p>Why is knowing about our Universe important? Or our Solar System? Imagine living in your own home and not knowing where each room is or which room is used for what. Well not knowing about the Universe is exactly like that. We live on planet Earth and planet Earth is part of our Solar System, which is located in the Milky Way Galaxy. <br><br>
				
				The Milky Way galaxy is only a small spec that is part of the immense Universe and this same Universe is an infinitely vast place of space. No one knows its exact size but several theories propose that it is, to this day, constantly expanding, meaning that it is only getting bigger and bigger every second of every minute. That's big. <em>Really</em> <strong>big</strong>. I mean, you just won’t believe how vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly <em><strong>BIG</strong></em> it is! No one knows for certain how the Universe came to be, either. Of these there are also a plethora of theories. You would think that theories are what make the world (and galaxy) go round. Why is the Universe here? Well there is a theory that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. And of course, there is another theory which states that this has <em>already</em> happened. All you really need to know for the moment is that the Universe is a lot more complicated than you might think, even if you start from a position of thinking it’s pretty damn complicated in the first place. But hey, it's okay, don't panic.</p>
